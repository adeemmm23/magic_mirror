## How does it work?
This module shows what you are currently listening in Spotify, including podcasts _(and later when available, audiobooks)_. I wanted it to be the best looking posible, so it extracts cover art colors to create a palette and theme itself (other modules too!) and it includes animations for almost everything. See all the options below to know more about the extensive customization and Dynamic Theming.

The module includes an **Authentication Service** that guide you through the configuration of an Spotify App. MMM-OnSpotify does **not use any third party service**, its an independent app, just the Spotify API.

> All the data stays in your mirror. If you have multiple mirrors, the **Authentication Service** guides you on creating a new Spotify App per mirror.

# Installation
### Step 1: Install the module
```bash
cd ~/modules
git clone https://github.com/Fabrizz/MMM-OnSpotify.git
cd MMM-OnSpotify
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create a Spotify App and authorize the module
[You can migrate from MMM-NowPlayinOnSpotify and skip this step!](#migrating-from-mmm-nowplayinginspotify)

Here we use the **Authentication Service** that guides you on each step of the process:

<img alt="MMM-OnSpotify banner" align="right" height="90" width="160" src=".github/content/banner-authservice.svg">

```bash
npm run auth
> [Authorization Service] ...
> [Authorization Service] Open http://localhost:8100/ to configure your mirror. 
```
Once you finish with the configuration, you are all set with the basic configuration. You can see all the theming/options below.
> When the service is running you can access it from your Raspberry Pi going to `http://localhost:8100/`. You can also access it remotely using `http://<IP>:8100/`. Note that using the Raspberry Pi is recommended, as its easier to copy the configuration snippet.

### General module options: 
| Option (config.option) | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-: | :-- |
| advertisePlayerTheme | `true` | If the module should send Dynamic Theme (lock/unlock) notifications. Read more about [Dynamic Theme](#dynamic-theme) below |
| displayWhenEmpty | `"both"` | What to display when the player is idle. Options are: <br />- `user`: Displays user card <br />- `affinity`: Shows user top albums/songs <br />- `both`: Combines the user card and affinity data <br />- `logo`: Displays the Spotify logo <br />- `none`: Display only when playing<br /><br /><img alt="Display when empty " src=".github/content/banner-onidle.png"> |
| userAffinityUseTracks | `false` | If you are showing affinity data on idle, you can select between showing album cover art or track cover art |
| prefersLargeImageSize | `false` | If you prefer to use higher resolution images. Defaults to false as its not really noticeable  |
| hideTrackLenghtAndAnimateProgress | `false` | If your update interval window is to high, you can opt to animate the bar and hide the timestamp |
| showDebugPalette | `false` | Shows the Vibrant output as a color palette and other theme related info <br /><br /> <img alt="Debug palette" src=".github/content/image-debugpalette.png" width="80%"> |
| userDataMaxAge | `14400` | (Seconds) The time in seconds of user data TTL. If set to 0, its updated everytime that the player goes to idle, as user data rarely changes, this allows a middle ground between updating always and only on boot |
| userAffinityMaxAge | `36000` | (Seconds) The time in seconds of affinity data TTL. If set to 0, its updated everytime that the player goes to idle, as user data rarely changes, this allows a middle ground between updating always and only on boot  |

### Interval options:
Here you can select different update intervals based on module state. If your window between calls is big, you can enable `hideTrackLenghtAndAnimateProgress`
| Option <br />(config.updateInterval.option) | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-: | :-- |
| isPlaying | `1` | Default interval when there is something in the player |
| isEmpty | `2` | Interval when the player is idle | 
| isPlayingHidden | `2` | Interval when the module is hidden from another module and there is something playing |
| isEmptyHidden | `3` | Interval when the module is hidden from another module and the player is idle |
| onReconnecting | `4` | Interval when there is an error fetching the API |
| onError | `8` | When the N° of errors reach a certain point, it changes "onReconnecting" to "onError", to slow down api calls |

### Theming options:
> Also see: [Disabling all color theming options](#other)

Note on theming: If you are using a **RPI4** I recommend to keep the default settings (or less), and if your two way mirror is not very good, I also recommend disabling the background colors.

If you are using the server separatelly or using a **higher power device**, you can turn on all the animations.

If you are using RPIs3 or below, disabling all the animations and [Vibrant usage](#other) is probably the best idea. 

| Option (config.theming.option) | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-: | :-- |
| mediaAnimations | `false` | Disable cover fade, useful if you are using a system that is not GPU powerful (RPIs).  |
| fadeAnimations | `false` | Disable fade in/out animations, useful if you are using a system that is not GPU powerful (RPIs). |
| transitionAnimations| `true` | Disable color transitions, useful if you are using a system that is not GPU powerful (RPIs). |
| spotifyCodeExperimentalShow | `true` | Shows the Spotify Bar Code for the current song/podcast/etc. This is an experimental feature, as the API is not documented <br /><br /><img alt="Spotify code" src=".github/content/image-spotifycode.png" aling="left" height="40"> |
| spotifyCodeExperimentalUseColor | `true` | As shown on the image above, color the spotify code bar using cover art colors |
| spotifyCodeExperimentalSeparateItem | `true` | Separates or joins the Spotify Code Bar to the cover art. Also respects `roundMediaCorners` and `spotifyCodeExperimentalUseColor` <br /><br /><img alt="Spotify code bar separation" src=".github/content/banner-codeseparation.png" aling="left" height="100">  |
| roundMediaCorners | `true` | If you want rounded corners in the cover art. Affects also the Spotify Code Bar |
| roundProgressBar | `true` | If you want a rounded progress bar |
| useColorInProgressBar | `true` | Use color in the progress bar. If `showBlurBackground` is enabled, the background behaviour differs |
| useColorInTitle | `true` | Use color in the title, artist and bar |
| useColorInUserData | `true` | If only the user bar is shown (`displayWhenEmpty: "user"`) |
| showBlurBackground | `true` | Shows the background colors |
| blurCorrectionInFrameSide | `false` | Fixes the color blur in the frame side of the display, making it look like there is no gap between the actual border and the display. View ilustration below<br /><br /><img alt="Blur separation" src=".github/content/banner-blurcorrection.png" aling="left"> |
| blurCorrectionInAllSides | `false` | Same as "InFrameSide", but blurs less all the borders for a more subtle effect |
| alwaysUseDefaultDeviceIcon | `false` | The device icon changes depending on the player type. If you don’t like this behaviour you can disable it |

# Dynamic Theme
The Dynamic Theme is a form of theming that all of my modules have. Its a way of "normalizing" color data. This module provides color data (Master), and other modules can listen to the notificactions and act accordingly. This module uses the `VIBRANT` scheme. Here is an example payload:
```js
{ /* ON MUSIC */
    provider: "MMM-OnSpotify",
    providerPrefix: "ONSP",
    providerScheme: "VIBRANT",
    // CSS VARS: --(ONSP)-(VIBRANT)-(VIBRANT-SCHEME-COLOR]
    set: "lock",
    until: "provider",
    priority: true,
    // Lock on [MMM-OnSpotify] until [provider] decides (player is empty)
}

{ /* ON EMPTY */
    provider: "MMM-OnSpotify",
    set: "unlock",
}
```
You can disable this behaviour using `advertisePlayerTheme: false`.

# Notification API
### `THEME_PREFERENCE` -->
> Explanation in [Dynamic Theme](#dynamic-theme).

### `NOW_PLAYING` -->
Everytime the player changes states or the song changes, the module sends a notification so other modules can, for example, [show lyrics](https://github.com/Fabrizz/MMM-LiveLyrics).

```js
{
    playerIsEmpty: false,
    name: "title",
    image: "https://i.scdn.co/[...]",
    artist: "artist",
    artists: ["artist 1", "artist 2", "artist 3"],
    type: "track", // "episode", etc
    device: "sonos kitchen",
    deviceType: "speaker",
}
```

### `GET_PLAYING` <--
Makes the module return a `NOW_PLAYING` notification, regardles of the state of the player. (Used by [MMM-LiveLyrics](https://github.com/Fabrizz/MMM-LiveLyrics))

# Migrating from MMM-NowPlayingInSpotify
After finishing the installation of the module, you can migrate your old credentials from **MMM-NowPlayingInSpotify**, the keys for the credentials are the same!, make sure to remove/disable MMM-NPOS, you can get rate limited by Spotify.
```js
{
    module: "MMM-OnSpotify",
        position: "bottom_right",
        config: {
            // Spotify credentials from MMM-NowPlayingOnSpotify
            clientID: "clientID",
            clientSecret: "clientSecret",
            accessToken: "accessToken",
            refreshToken: "refreshToken",
        }
}
```

# Other:
- You can disable all the color related stuff and use the module as is. You need to disable all the color related fields: <br />`advertisePlayerTheme`, `theming.useColorInProgressBar`, `theming.useColorInTitle`, `theming.useColorInTitleBorder`, `theming.showBlurBackground`, `theming.useColorInUserData`, `theming.spotifyCodeExperimentalUseColor`.<br /> <img alt="MMM-OnSpotify no theming" src=".github/content/image-modulebasic.png" width="200"> <br /> Of course you can still use the Spotify Color bar (White/Gray). This image is the base module. <br /> Disabling all theming options also stop the module from loading the [Vibrant](/vendor) lib.

- The API for Spotify Codes is not public, as its from the Spotify CDN (_scannables.scdn.co_) The API could change without notice. Many libraries rely on it and using it does not go againts the ToS.

- I probably made some spelling mistakes in this readme / the authentication service. Please open an issue so I can fix them!
